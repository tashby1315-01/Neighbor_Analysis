3 Actions to Increase Revenue 28-50%
Problem: We're losing 78,270 potential customers who view storage units but don't book.
1. Fix Our Booking Pages (30 days)

Current: 11.7% of viewers actually book
Action: Better photos, simpler booking process, mobile optimization
Result: +2,791 bookings (+28% revenue)

2. Smart Marketing Spend (60 days)

Current: Spending equally across all channels
Action: Track which ads actually drive bookings, not just clicks
Result: +10-15% marketing ROI

3. Copy Our Payment Success (90 days)

Current: 95% payment success rate vs 12% booking rate
Action: Apply payment team's methods to booking process
Result: Potential for massive booking improvements

Bottom Line: Our payment process works perfectly. Our booking process doesn't. Fix the booking process using what already works, and we could see 40-50% revenue growth.
Investment Required: Minimal - mostly process improvements and budget reallocation.
